# Contributing

A contributors guide to Micro

## Guidelines

Our current contributor guide is fairly simple

1. Open an issue to discuss a bug or feature request
2. Work with the existing maintainer to outline a plan
3. Implement the fix or feature as a pull request
4. Seek feedback on the PR and make any necessary changes
6. Have the PR approved by at least 2 maintainers
7. Sign-off using the DCO signature format
6. PR is merged if all is good
