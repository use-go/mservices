# Clients

Clients are multi-language clients for Micro

## Overview

Clients are multi-language clients used with the micro runtime to access services and resources. 
The clients are code generated in multiple languages based on proto and our goal is to wrap 
them with idiomatic client libraries in each language.

The clients can be found in [github.com/micro/clients](https://github.com/micro/clients).

## Objectives

- Code generate SDKs based on micro runtime services
- Wrap the SDKs in more idiomatic clients per language
- Enable multi-language development using the micro server
