V2 docs are docs preserved for version 2 of micro.

## Overview

Version 2 was mostly a transition between v1 and v3 where we attempted to try various ideas like gRPC and NATs by default, 
along with a global service network and single startup command for all services. Many people still want to use it and 
they relied on the docs so we preserve them for that reason
