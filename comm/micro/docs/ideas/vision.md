# Vision

Vision is a computer vision client for micro

## Overview

Vision is a far out idea of adding a new client to the micro runtime that 
enables images and video to be streamed into the platform. This is likely 
2-3 years out but ideally it enables us to not only input images but 
also output augmented images.
